If you upload the files directly to your server/domain, it will NOT work.

Full Source Files are only meant for Local Development. 
After you have made the customizations to the application, then you need to upload only some particular files and folders.

Kindly refer to this documentation properly:

The above documentation clearly elaborates how you can setup your local development enviroment for Foodomaa and deploy after making your necessary customizations.
